# Ima Miru


## Project Description 

Ima Miru (translates to "watch now") is an application where users can browse various anime shows and gather details on them. Users who sign up will be able to add a new show to the list of shows that are currently on the app. Users will also be able to save shows of interest in a section called Watchlist. Watchlist will display the shows that the user has saved as a reminder to check them out in the future.
